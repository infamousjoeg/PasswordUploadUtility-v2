PUUv2 Changelog:

Edited:
	line 39: commented out as it was causing errors in my environment and I couldn't get it resolved. Can uncomment if desired for newer TLS.
	line 59-60: commented out LDAP password
	line 63-64: added 2-factor Radius auth
	line 67: added useRadiusAuthentication = 'True' to leverage 2-factor instead of AD auth
	line 108: added additional params to function
	line 118-125: sends different parameters based off the attributes that are populated in the spreadsheet
					if both database and logondomain are populated in the same row then it will only send database due to order of if else statement. Could adjust if desired.
	line 128: added to convert bodyParams to appropriate JSON syntax
	line 131: added Write-Host $bodyParams to be used for debugging. Throws up the JSON on the screen to check syntax, uncomment when needed

	line 210-212: added additional parameters for AD/oracle accounts
	line 230: updated the if/$getResult count to be "-gt 0" otherwise it would never add an account for me. Since if it counts something that is the same username/address then the count would be 1
	line 235-246: added if else statement for different types of accounts

BUG: If multiple account types (e.g., Oracle and AD) are in the same import file, then the additional properties (Port, LogonDomain, Database) can show up on accounts as artifacts.
    Example: if row two has an account with Port/Database populated, then row 3 might also have port and database get populated, even if it is blank. I am not sure why, maybe a caching issue?
    Workaround: just use separate import files for different types of accounts (1 file for Oracle, 1 for AD, 1 for local, etc)

TODO: add parameter for "Limit Domain Access To"
